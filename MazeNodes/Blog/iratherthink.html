                        A fox being caught in a trap was glad to save his neck by leaving his tail behind him. 
                        Upon coming abroad into the world, he began to be so sensible of the disgrace such a defect 
                        would bring upon him, that he almost wished he had died rather than come away without it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Resolving to make the best of a bad matter, he called a meeting of the rest of the foxes 
                        and proposed that all should follow his example. "You have no notion," said he, "of the 
                        ease and comfort with which I now move about: I could never have believed it if I had not tried 
                        it myself. But really, when one comes to reason upon it, a tail is such an ugly, inconvenient, 
                        unnecessary appendage, that the only wonder is that, as foxes, we could have put up with it so long. 
                        I propose, therefore, my worthy brethren, that you all profit by the experience that I am most willing to 
                        afford you and that all foxes from this day forward cut off their tails."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon this one of the oldest stepped forward and said, "I rather think, my friend, that you 
                        would not have advised us to part with our tails, <a href="reynard.html">if</a> there were any chance of recovering your own."
