<p>                    Call me away; there's nothing here,
</p><p>                    That wins my soul to stay;
</p><p>                    Then let me leave this prospect drear,
</p><p>                    And hasten far away.
</p><p>                    To our beloved land I'll flee,
</p><p>                    Our land of thought and soul,
</p><p>                    Where I have roved so oft with thee,
</p><p>                    Beyond the world's control.
</p><p>                    I'll sit and watch those ancient trees,
</p><p>                    Those Scotch firs dark and high;
</p><p>                    I'll listen to the eerie breeze,
</p><p>                    Among their branches sigh.
</p><p>                    The glorious moon shines far above;
</p><p>                    How soft her radiance falls,
</p><p>                    On snowy heights, and rock, and grove;
</p><p>                    And yonder palace walls!
</p><p>                    Who stands beneath yon fir trees high?
</p><p>                    A <a href="./stars.html">youth</a> both slight and fair,
</p><p>                    Whose bright and restless azure eye
</p><p>                    Proclaims him known to care,
</p><p>                    Though fair that brow, it is not smooth;
</p><p>                    Though small those features, yet in sooth
</p><p>                    Stern passion has been there.
</p><p>                    Now on the peaceful moon are fixed
</p><p>                    Those eyes so glistening bright,
</p><p>                    But trembling teardrops hang betwixt,
</p><p>                    And dim the <a href="indwelling.html">blessed light</a>.
</p><p>                    Though late the hour, and keen the blast,
</p><p>                    That whistles round him now,
</p><p>                    Those raven locks are backward cast,
</p><p>                    To cool his burning brow.
</p><p>                    His hands above his heaving breast
</p><p>                    Are clasped in agony —
</p><p>                    'O Father! Father! let me rest!
</p><p>                    And call my soul to thee!
</p><p>                    I know 'tis weakness thus to pray;
</p><p>                    But all this cankering care –
</p><p>                    This doubt tormenting night and day
</p><p>                    Is more than I can bear!
</p><p>                    With none to comfort, none to guide
</p><p>                    And none to strengthen me.
</p><p>                    Since thou my only friend hast died –
</p><p>                    I've <a href="weareseven.html">pined to follow thee</a>!
</p><p>                    Since thou hast died! And did he live
</p><p>                    What comfort could his counsel give –
</p><p>                    To one forlorn like me?
</p><p>                    Would he my Idol's form adore –
</p><p>                    Her soul, her glance, her tone?
</p><p>                    And say, “Forget for ever more
</p><p>                    Her kindred and thine own;
</p><p>                    Let dreams of her thy peace destroy,
</p><p>                    Leave every other hope and joy
</p><p>                    And live for her alone”?'
</p><p>                    He starts, he smiles, and dries the tears,
</p><p>                    Still glistening on his cheek,
</p><p>                    The lady of his soul appears,
</p><p>                    And hark! I hear her speak –
</p><p>                    'Aye, dry thy tears; thou wilt not weep –
</p><p>                    While I am by thy side –
</p><p>                    Our foes all day their watch may keep
</p><p>                    But cannot thus divide
</p><p>                    Such hearts as ours; and we tonight
</p><p>                    Together in the clear moon's light
</p><p>                    Their malice will deride.
</p><p>                    No fear our present bliss shall blast
</p><p>                    And sorrow we'll defy.
</p><p>                    Do thou forget the dreary past,
</p><p>                    The dreadful future I.'
</p><p>                    Forget it? Yes, while thou art by
</p><p>                    I think of nought but thee,
</p><p>                    'Tis only when thou art not nigh
</p><p>                    Remembrance tortures me.
</p><p>                    But such a lofty soul to find,
</p><p>                    And such a heart as thine,
</p><p>                    In such a glorious form enshrined
</p><p>                    And still to call thee mine –
</p><p>                    Would be for earth too great a bliss,
</p><p>                    Without a taint of woe like this,
</p><p>                    Then why should I repine? </p>
