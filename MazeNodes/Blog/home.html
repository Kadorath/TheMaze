                        The Emperor—so the story goes—has sent a message to you, the lone individual, 
                        the meanest of his subjects, the shadow that has fled before the Imperial sun until it is 
                        microscopic in the remotest distance, just to you has the Emperor sent a message from his deathbed. 
                        He made the <a href="./themessenger.html">messenger</a> kneel by his bed and whispered the message into his ear; he felt it to be so 
                        important that he made the mean repeat it into his own ear. With a nod of the head he confirmed that 
                        the repetition was accurate. And then, before the whole retinue gathered to witness his death—all the 
                        walls blocking the view had been broken down and on the wide high curve of the open stairway stood the 
                        notables of the Empire in the circle—before them all he dispatched the messenger. The messenger set off at once; 
                        a strong, an indefatigable man; thrusting out now one arm, now the other, he forces his way through the crowd; where 
                        he finds obstacles he points to the sign of <a href="thesun.html">the sun</a> on his breast; he gets through easily, too, as no one else could.
                        Yet the throng is so numerous; there is no end to their dwelling places. If he only had a free field before him, how he would run, 
                        and soon enough you would hear the glorious tattoo of his fists on your door. But instead of that, how vain are his efforts; he is still 
                        forcing his way through the chambers of the innermost palace; he will never get to the end of them; and even if he did, he would be no 
                        better off; he would have to fight his way down the stairs; and even if he did that, he would be no better off; he would still have to get 
                        through the courtyards; and after the courtyards, the second outer palace inyards; and still another palace; and so on for thousands of years; 
                        and did he finally dash through the outermost gate—but never, never can that happen— he would still have <a href="thecapital.html">the capital city</a> 
                        before him, the center of the world, overflowing with the dregs of humanity. No one can force a way through that, least of all with 
                        a message from a deadman. 
                        —But you sit by your window and dream it all true, when evening falls.
