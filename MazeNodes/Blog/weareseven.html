                    ———A simple Child,
                    That lightly draws its breath,
                    And feels its life in every limb,
                    What should it know of death?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I met a little cottage Girl:
                    She was eight years old, she said;
                    Her hair was thick with many a curl
                    That clustered round her head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She had a rustic, woodland air,
                    And she was wildly clad:
                    Her eyes were fair, and very fair;
                    —Her beauty made me glad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sisters and brothers, little Maid,
                    How many may you be?”
                    “How many? Seven in all,” she said,
                    And wondering looked at me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And where are they? I pray you tell.”
                    She answered, “Seven are we;
                    And two of us at Conway dwell,
                    And two are gone to sea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Two of us in the church-yard lie,
                    My sister and my brother;
                    And, in the church-yard cottage, I
                    Dwell near them with my mother.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You say that two at Conway dwell,
                    And two are gone to sea,
                    Yet ye are seven! I pray you tell,
                    Sweet Maid, how this may be.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then did the little Maid reply,
                    “Seven boys and girls are we;
                    Two of us in the church-yard lie,
                    Beneath the church-yard tree.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You run about, my little Maid,
                    Your limbs they are alive;
                    If two are in the church-yard laid,
                    Then ye are only five.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Their graves are green, they may be seen,”
                    The little Maid replied,
                    “Twelve steps or more from my mother's door,
                    And they are side by side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “My stockings there I often knit,
                    My kerchief there I hem;
                    And there upon the ground I sit,
                    And sing a song to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And often after sun-set, Sir,
                    When it is light and fair,
                    I take my little porringer,
                    And eat my supper there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The first that died was sister Jane;
                    In bed she moaning lay,
                    Till God released her of her pain;
                    And then she went away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So in the church-yard she was laid;
                    And, when the grass was dry,
                    Together round her grave we played,
                    My brother John and I.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And when the ground was white with snow,
                    And I could run and slide,
                    My brother John was forced to go,
                    And he lies by her side.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “How many are you, then,” said I,
                    “If they two are in heaven?”
                    Quick was the little Maid's reply,
                    “O Master! we are seven.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “But they are dead; those two are dead!
                    Their spirits are in heaven!”
                    'Twas throwing words away; for still
                    The little Maid would have her will,
                    And said, “<a href="churchyard.html">Nay</a>, we are seven!”
